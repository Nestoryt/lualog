LuaLog is a universal logging aggregator for GMod.  It's currently in the developmental stage, and is focused primarily on ULX logs.  The code is being refactored and expanded to handle multiple logging systems (console log, ULX, addon-specific logs, etc), as well as in-game hooks to important events.

Additionally, the data storage code is being refactored and expanded to handle db's other than Sqlite.

Stay tuned!
